# LEDMatrix
These are codes for a 32x16 LED matrix. It will display some sort of color changing action.

**FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO WORK YOU MUST INTALL LIBRARIES ( Adafruit_GFX.h AND RGBmatrixPanel.h )**

*To do so you can go into the IDE and go to sketch/includelibrary/managelibraries. Search Adafruit gfx and install, then search RGB matrix panel and install that library as well.*

*any questions or comments feel free to contact me through email: donovankitten@gmail.com or Instagram @donovan._.k*
