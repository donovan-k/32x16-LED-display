# LEDdisplayspeaker
These are codes for DKInnovation Display Speaker X. It is a portable speaker with a full LED panel display. This repository will have many examples of code to upload to arduino for it to animate on the LED display. 
**FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO WORK YOU MUST INTALL LIBRARIES ( Adafruit_GFX.h AND RGBmatrixPanel.h )
*To do so you can go into the IDE and go to sketch/includelibrary/managelibraries. Search Adafruit gfx and install, then search RGB matrix panel and install that library as well.*
*any questions or comments feel free to contact me through email: donovankitten@gmail.com or Instagram @dkinnovation
